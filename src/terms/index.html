Prospective investors should perform their own due diligence and seek advice from an independent legal, tax or financial advisor, where necessary, to determine the suitability and appropriateness of an investment prior to making an investment decision.</p> 
      <p>Subject to InvestaX’s approval in each case, which approval shall be in InvestaX’s sole discretion, a fundraising campaign may be initiated by InvestaX on behalf of the Offering Company. InvestaX does not guarantee that a campaign will be funded or successful, or that a fundraising campaign will remain open for funding for any guaranteed amount of time. A fundraising campaign may be terminated or cancelled at the discretion of the Offering Company, or by InvestaX for violation of these Terms of Use or in connection with any other governing agreements between the Offering Company and InvestaX, or for any reason and at any time by providing prior notice to the Offering Company.</p>

You may be required to update such information and any Registration Data prior to any subsequent investment. We reserve the right to investigate any suspicious transactions and to request documentation to confirm authenticity and accuracy of any information you provide to us. Your account may be rejected, restricted or closed if InvestaX cannot verify such required information. Any information you are required to provide InvestaX during the registration and approval process will be handled in accordance with the <a href="../privacy_policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
